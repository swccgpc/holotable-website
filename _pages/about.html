<p class="pagetitle">About The Holotable</p>
<p>The Holotable was created by Rogue4 and LtPage2 in September of 2004 to 
  satisfy the need for a visible and easily accessible online community for 
  Star Wars CCG players to meet and play online.

  I'm 22 and a Biomedical Engineer, hence I leave the programming to the amazing 
  Matt.  I run the actual physical server (eventually more than one), and do some 
  basic PR work.  I started with SWCCG back with the 2-player Hoth set and haven't 
  stopped since.  Feel free to contact me with questions or suggestions.  I'm 
  always willing to help (or at least do my best).<br />

  I'm 30 and married with a son and two daughters.  
  I work as a software engineer.  I've collected SWCCG since Premiere and have 
  played sporadically, though not as often as I would have liked.  I am the sole 
  developer for Holotable and Holodeck.  I have never played a complete game of 
  SWCCG online.  My wife says I actually sort of resemble this guy (I'm certainly 
  not balding, though!).<br />
