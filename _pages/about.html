<p class="pagetitle">About The Holotable</p>
<p>The Holotable was created by <strong>Rustan Sharer</strong> <em>(Rogue4)</em> and <strong>Matt Moseley</strong> <em>(LtPage2)</em> in September of 2004 to satisfy the need for a visible and easily accessible online community for Star Wars CCG players to meet and play online.

  I am a Biomedical Engineer, hence I leave the programming to the amazing Matt. I started with SWCCG back with the 2-player Hoth set and haven't stopped since.<br />

  I am married with a son and two daughters. I work as a software engineer. I've collected SWCCG since Premiere and have  played sporadically, though not as often as I would have liked. I am the sole  developer for Holotable and Holodeck. I have never played a complete game of SWCCG online. My wife says I actually sort of resemble this guy <em>(I'm certainly  not balding, though!)</em>.
