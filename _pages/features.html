      <p class="pagetitle">What is Holotable?</p>
      <p>Holotable is the name of a program created from scratch by LtPage2 
      which allows Star Wars CCG aficionados to play their customizable card 
      game online. Holotable boasts a myriad of improvements over other 
      similar programs, namely, the ability for gamers behind firewalls/routers 
      to play games via a dedicated server (the same server which now hosts this 
      website).</p>

<p class="pagetitle">Brief history of Holotable.com</p>
<p align="left">
This site was created in order to give SWCCG players a place to meet and play 
this great game online. Originally focusing on a program known as 
Cardtable, the Holotable launched in September of 2004 with the goal of 
&quot;ultimately having the most complete database of online SWCCG players on the 
internet.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">
Subsequent input from the community resulted in the establishment of a permanent 
server through which players behind firewalls could host and play games. 
Unfortunately the limitations of the Cardtable program (which was several years 
old and never updated) prevented the use of the server, which would otherwise have
functioned correctly.</p>
<p align="left">
After several unsuccessful attempts to gain access to the source code, Matt (LtPage2) 
finally gave up on Cardtable and started work on a brand-new program from 
scratch. This new program was named &quot;Holotable&quot; and is the focus of this 
website.</p>
<p align="left">
The forums here are provided so players can easily get in touch with one another 
and organize games. Ultimately, we hope to have the most complete database 
of online SWCCG players on the internet.</p>
<p align="left">
In the future, The Holotable will (hopefully) run online tournaments, keep 
players up-to-date with the most current files, and provide pre-constructed 
decks from current and past World Champions (among others) to the public.</p>
