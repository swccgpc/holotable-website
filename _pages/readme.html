Holotable version 0.9.6/Holodeck version 0.3.9<br />
Copyright 2004-2013 Matt Moseley
</p>

<p class="sectionheader">
Windows installation:
</p>

<p>
Use the installer to put Holotable in whatever directory you like.  You will not be 
able to see card images in either Holotable or Holodeck until the image root 
directory is set correctly in the holotable.ini initialization file, which should be 
taken care of by the installer (on Windows).
</p>

<p>
If you want to, create a shortcut on your desktop.  One way to do this is to right 
click on Holotable.exe, select "Create Shortcut", and then move it to your desktop. 
You can also select "Send to" and then "Desktop (create shortcut)".
</p>

<p>
Install the GTK+ runtime if you don't already have it (you need at 
least minor version 2.12).  A Windows port can be downloaded at <br />
<br />
<a href="{{ site.downloadables.windows.gtk2.url }}">
{{ site.downloadables.windows.gtk2.name }}
</a><br />
<br />
Install that and everything should be happy.
</p>

<p class="sectionheader">
Linux installation:
</p>

<p>
Before doing anything else, you need to make sure you have GTK+ 2.12, SDL, and SDL_net 
on your system.  GTK+ can be downloaded from www.gtk.org.  SDL and SDL_net can be 
downloaded from www.libsdl.org.  You may also be able to find RPMs or other binary 
packages from various websites.
</p>

<p>
Untar the Holotable *.tar.bz2 packages in a directory of your choosing.  For example, 
you may wish to create a "holotable" directory in your home directory.  Move the 
packages there, then untar/bzip with something like:
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">
tar xjf holotable-0.8.3_install.tar.bz2
</p>

<p>
[Note: full Holotable packages for Linux will create a "holotable" directory in the directory 
where the package is extracted.  Other packages (such as program updates, card image updates, etc.)
should be extracted in the "holotable" directory itself.]
</p>

<p>
This will extract the files needed to run Holotable and Holodeck.  If you've downloaded 
the images, you will need to do the same thing with their *.tar.bz2 files.
</p>

<p>
You will now need to edit the holotable.ini file to reference the correct directories 
for your images, the background image, and the default deck directory.  You can also 
do this from the Table menu (select "Options") in Holotable.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you need to set the HOLOTABLE_PATH environment variable to point to the directory where 
you installed Holotable.  As an example for those who aren't so familiar with Linux, something 
like this ought to work when placed in your .bashrc file in your home directory (often 
/home/username/.bashrc):<br />
<br />
export HOLOTABLE_PATH=/home/username/holotable<br />
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 50px; text-indent: -40px">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span>
 The Holotable and Holodeck binaries were built on Fedora Core 4.  They may or may 
 not work on other Linuxes; pandemonium may ensue when trying to run them somewhere
 else.  I've done some testing on Fedora Core 4, and everything seems to more or less 
 work.  As a side note, if your opponent is on Windows and didn't build his deck post 
 V10, you may not see all of the images for his cards.  This is because the CDF files 
 were converted to reference images with all lowercase letter filenames at that time.  
 Having your opponent rebuild the deck from scratch (or converting the deck file by 
 hand) from a CDF that includes at least Virtual Set 10 should solve the problem.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px; text-indent: -40px">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Note 2:</span>
 Holotable 0.7.5 and 0.8.0 were built on Zenwalk 3.0.  Holotable 0.8.1 and Holodeck 
 0.3.2 were built on Zenwalk 4.2.  As before, your mileage may vary, but please let 
 me know if you have any troubles.
</p>


<p class="sectionheader">
Decks:
</p>

<p>
Holodeck is what you should use for building decks.  It has updated CDFs that are
compatible with the images you can download from The Holotable website.  It also 
removes problems with special characters that can crash Holotable.  As of version 
0.1.1, you can edit previously-saved decks.  Several problems related to saving 
decks are now fixed, and there is a counter for the number of cards in the deck.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.1.2 added the ability to "zoom" images just like Holotable, and the three 
key areas of the window can be resized through the use of panes (like the hand area 
in Holotable).  There is also a fix for crashes caused by pressing keys when the 
focus was in the list of cards from which to select or the deck list.  Now pressing 
'a' in either place is analogous to pressing the "Add card" button.  When the focus 
is in the deck list, pressing 'd' will remove one copy of the selected card, and the 
up and down arrow keys move a card up and down (respectively) in the deck order.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.1.3 was a bugfix release that removed a problem where Holodeck would crash 
if you opened it and then tried to load a deck before opening a CDF file.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.1.4 changed several things regarding key bindings.  The list of cards to 
add to your deck may now be navigated by pressing letters and numbers; if one exists, 
the first card that starts with the same letter or number will automatically be 
selected.  Also, the up and down arrow keys now change the selection in either list 
(previously they moved a card up or down in the deck list and had no effect in 
the list of cards from which to choose).
</p>

<p>
Version 0.1.5 fixed a bug where, if the cursor was left over the small image preview 
as the selected card was changed, the resulting popups would never go away.  It also
changed the order cards are added to the deck list; now, cards are prepended to the 
list, so cards added first (usually starting cards) end up at the bottom of the list. 
This way starting cards will be at the top of the deck when loaded in Holotable.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.2.0 made some much-needed improvements.  The ability to filter by card set 
was added (it had been disabled since 0.1.0 a year before), and a basic search 
capability was added.  Also, the card type can now be set to "all" so that cards of all 
types can be shown when doing a search, etc.  The ability to export the deck as a plain 
.txt file listing of the cards was also added.
</p>

<p>     
Version 0.2.1 added the ability to specify cards as "starting"; this causes them to be 
loaded into the starting cards pile in Holotable.  Also, the average destiny of the 
deck (without starting cards) can be calculated, and opening draws may be simulated 
as well (also without starting cards).  Finally, you can also select destiny as a 
search criterion.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.3.0 improved the search capabilities by separating the lore and gametext search
criteria and adding search of the icons text.  Also, the comparison operators =, &gt;=, &lt;=, 
and != can be used for searching destiny, deploy, forfeit, power, ability, armor, maneuver, 
defense value, hyperspeed, and landspeed.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.3.1 fixed a memory leak that occurred when using the large image popup 
feature.  Also, advanced or basic search can be selected; basic search provides much fewer 
options, but also makes the Holodeck window smaller.  Ctrl-F activates the Search button, 
and Ctrl-C activates the clear button.  Repeatedly pressing a letter or number key while 
focus is in the "cards to choose from" list will advance the selection to the next card 
that starts with that letter or number.  A "Card Type" column was added to the "cards to 
choose from" list.
</p>

<p>     
Version 0.3.2 added the ability to search through the "cards to choose from" list by 
putting the focus in the list and then typing the letters in the card name you're looking 
for.  The list will be searched as you enter the letters in the name up until no cards 
match the name; the search string is reset to nothing when a card is added to your deck, 
when the card selection is changed by clicking with the mouse or using the up/down arrow 
keys, when the list loses focus, or when the Escape key is pressed.  Additionally, a 
separate window that contains the deck list with sortable columns is available, and a card 
summary dialog was added (open it to see the current count of cards of different types).  
Finally, you can change the order of cards in the deck by holding Control and pressing the 
up/down arrow keys -- this should speed reordering the deck).
</p>

<p>
Version 0.3.3 changed the .htd deck file format to version 2, which does not store card 
text in the deck file.  The card text is read from the CDF files, both in Holodeck and 
Holotable.  This allows deck files to be kept up to date (with errata and error corrections) 
just by getting updated CDF files.  Any old style deck files will be converted to use the 
new format if they are loaded and then saved.  Note that cards that have changed name (as a 
result of the Virtual Card Revolution, etc.) will not be able to be converted automatically.  
These must be removed manually and have the new card name added back.  Holodeck will try to 
indicate cards that no longer exist in the CDF and should be removed.  The basic search 
format is now the default window configuration.  Several "generic" card types are now 
available for the type filter -- so now you can filter by any character, rather than just 
Rebels, etc.  The deck list is now sortable by any column (previously availabe through a 
separate window accessible through a menu item).  If you try to change the order of any 
card in the deck, the view will revert to the deck order view (removing any sorting).  The 
average destiny of the non-starting cards in the deck is always shown on the main window.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.3.4 added the ability to generate randomized decks (with the card pool selectable 
by set).  A problem where starting cards in old deck files were not recognized was fixed.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.3.5 fixed a problem where Holodeck would crash if cards were added to a deck while 
the sort order on the deck was not the default.  Exporting a deck list to a text file now 
uses the current sort order of the deck.  When sorted by set or card type, headers are 
placed in the file indicating the set or card type, respectively, for the group of cards 
that follow.  There is a new menu item to allow the user to export the deck list to a 
directory and filename of their choosing.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.3.6 fixed a problem with the deck list becoming unsorted when a card is newly 
added to the deck.  Made image popup work more consistently when the card selection 
changes.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.3.7 fixed a problem where the number of starting cards was zeroed when a deck was 
loaded from a previously-existing deck file.  Keys to increment and decrement the number of 
copies (of the currently-selected card in the deck list) marked as starting were added ('s' 
and 'r', respectively).  The "average destiny" menu item was changed to give general destiny 
information; it now provides the number of non-starting cards of each destiny value (0-7 and 
other).
</p>

<p>
Version 0.3.8 added the ability to select multiple cards from the deck list to manipulate at 
once.  This allows adding extra copies, changing the number of copies of each that are marked 
starting, and deleting copies of the selected cards.
</p>

<p>
Version 0.3.9 fixed a problem with crashes when adding a new card to a deck when the deck 
list was sorted by name.

<p>
File->Load deck... - loads a deck into your hand<br />
File->Load game... - loads a saved game.  For two-player games, your 
                opponent must enter the correct password for the 
                load to succeed.<br />
File->Save game... - saves card information to a file, automatically appending 
                ".htg" if there is no file extension specified.  
                Table size and pile positions are saved as well.  
                There must be at least one card loaded in order 
                to save a game.<br />
File->Check for updates - Checks the Internet to determine if the 
                latest version of Holotable has been 
                installed.  Also checks for CDF and image file  
                updates and gives the user the option to 
                automatically download and install them.<br />
File->Quit - exits Holotable<br />
<br />
Table->Undo - undoes the last card movement.<br />
Table->Redo - redoes the last movement that was undone.<br />
Table->Clear local - removes all local cards from your hand, the 
           table, and the opponent's hand.<br />
Table->Clear all - removes all cards from your hand, the table, 
         and the opponent's hand (use this wisely, as
         your opponent may not play with you again if
         you do it when you're losing!).<br />
Table->Options... - set up various Holotable options (including 
       image root directory and default deck directory - 
       the image root directory must be set correctly, or 
       you won't be able to see card images).<br />
Table->Command Window... - opens a window where you can use buttons to 
                 accomplish all pile movement actions and 
                 searches as well as swap sides<br />
Table->Detach chat/log window - removes the chat/log window from the area 
                      next to the hand and puts it in a 
                      separate window<br />
Table->Detach hand window - removes the hand window from the area next 
                  to the chat/log and puts it in a separate 
                  window<br />
Table->Hide phase/turn and status bars - hides the bottom two bars in 
                               order to provide more table 
                               visibility<br />
Table->Choose side - randomly chooses Light or Dark Side and indicates this 
           by a chat message to your opponent
<br />

        to the IP/hostname and port set in the 
        Options dialog.<br />
Server->Accept - set up your machine as a server for a peer to 
       peer connection from another player.  Listens 
       on the port specified in the Options dialog.
       (You may not be able to accept connections 
       depending on your network configuration).<br />
Server->Disconnect - disconnect from a server you've connected to.<br />
Server->Cancel Accept - stop listening for a peer to peer 
              connection.<br />
Server->End Game - if you are playing via the central server, you 
         can end your game and return to the lobby 
         without disconnecting and reconnecting.  Your 
         opponent will be returned there as well.  When 
         observing a game, this takes only you back to 
         the central server lobby.<br />
<br />
Help->Key reference... - Open a keyboard reference dialog, which will 
                      stay above other windows.<br />
Help->About - list some information about Holotable.
</p>


<p class="sectionheader">
Playing a game:
</p>

<p>
Once you've found someone to play against, you need to get connected.
</p>

<p>
Peer to peer:<br />
One player chooses Server->Accept, and the other player sets the first 
player's IP address and port number in their options.  The second 
player then chooses Server->Connect.  Note that, depending on your 
network configuration, you may not be able to accept incoming 
connections. Firewall software must be configured to allow incoming 
connections to Holotable ("act as a server"); routers generally need 
to be configured to allow incoming traffic on the port number you 
are trying to use, and they may need to be set to do port forwarding.
</p>

<p>
Central server (current IP is www.holotable.com):<br />
Both players put the central server's IP address and port number 5320 
in their options.  Both players then choose Server->Connect.  This 
will connect to the central server, which requires authentication.  
You must enter the password associated with your account on the Holotable
website forums (your username in Table->Options must also match the 
username from the forum account).  After you've entered the correct 
password, you will see the server lobby.  You can chat with other users 
and request games here.  If you request a game from yourself, you will 
automatically be rejected.  Any user you request a game with will see 
a dialog box that allows them to accept or reject the game.  If they 
accept, you will see a message in the status bar area reflecting 
that, and the server lobby dialog will disappear.  You can then load 
your decks and start playing.
</p>

<p>
Once there is a connection, both players should load their decks (it is
EXTREMELY important that this be done AFTER the connection is made, and
that no cards were on either player's table beforehand).  Wait for one 
person's deck to load before loading the other deck.  The status bar on 
the right should report details about the connection, including how many 
remote cards have been loaded.  Once decks are loaded, go ahead and play!
</p>

<p>
Your opponent's cards will show up rotated 180 degrees from their view, 
just like if you were sitting across the table from them.  Their cards 
will also be on the other side of the table.  So when you play your 
cards on the "bottom" of the table, they show up to your opponent at 
the top.  It is important that both of you have the same dimensions 
set for the playing surface size.  Otherwise the one with the smaller 
dimension might end up with cards all stacked on each other that 
shouldn't be.  The default option to auto-adjust the table size to the 
largest dimensions will take care of this for you if both players have 
it turned on when a game is started.
</p>


<p class="sectionheader">
Central server lobby operation:
</p>

<p>
The central server lobby provides a place for players to meet and chat 
as well as find opponents for games.  When you log on to the server, 
a window will appear that shows you the username, status, and location 
of everyone who is currently online.  The number of people currently 
playing a game is shown; if you place your mouse cursor over that text, 
a tooltip will appear that shows the names of these players.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of the window is a combo box with various status choices.  
You may use these options to indicate what you are doing in the lobby.  
If you choose "Away", anyone who requests a game from you will 
automatically be rejected, and you will not see the request.
</p>

<p>
To request a game with someone, select their username in the list and 
click the "Request game" button.  That user will see a dialog box pop 
up which will give them the option of accepting or rejecting your 
request.  If your request is accepted, the server lobby window will 
disappear and you will be placed back in the main Holotable window, 
where you can load decks and start your game.  If the request is 
rejected, a message indicating that will appear in your chat/log 
window on the main Holotable screen.  Note that requests are also 
automatically rejected if the other user has their own game request 
pending, someone else has already requested a game from them and they 
have yet to respond, or the user has configured Holotable to ignore you.
</p>

<p>
The "Observation" button opens a dialog containing a list of the current 
games in progress.  You may select one of the games in the list and 
click the button to request observation of that game.  The players will 
see your request and have the choice to accept or reject it.  If either 
player rejects your request, you will be notified and you will stay in 
the lobby.  If both players accept it, the lobby dialog will go away and 
the game will load for you.  Each player's name will appear by their 
Reserve Deck for a short period.  You will be able to chat with the 
players and any other observers, but you cannot manipulate the cards or 
see anyone's hand.  Either player may kick you out at any time, and you 
will return to the lobby.  If you are done watching the game, you can 
select "End game" from the Server menu to go back to the lobby.
</p>

<p>
In order to provide a way to avoid harassment of various sorts that was 
previously possible, you may set up a list of users to ignore while on 
the central server.  You will still see the user in the user list, but 
you will not see any of their chat messages sent to the lobby or any 
of their game requests (which will automatically be rejected).  You 
may set up your list by clicking the 'Ignore list' button while 
logged onto the central server.  If a user is selected in the user 
list area, the entry field will be prepopulated with that name when the 
dialog opens.  You may choose to ignore a user permanently, in which 
case the user will always be in your ignore list until you delete them.  
If you ignore a user without choosing the permanent option, the user 
will only be ignored until you close Holotable.
</p>

<p>
You may whisper to a user by selecting the checkbox and choosing a user 
in the combo box.  When you whisper, only you and the other user will 
see the message (it will be indicated by a "[whispered to &lt;user&gt;]" tag 
prepended to the message).
</p>


<p class="sectionheader">
Quick end turn indicator:
</p>

<p>
In Holotable 0.8.3 a new feature was introduced to make indicating the end 
of turns easier.  The area between the "Ready for phase change" button and 
the "Pause game" button initially has "My turn" in it.  When a game is 
started, the user who clicks in this area first will have the area turn 
green with "End turn" text in it.  The other user will see the area turn 
red with "Opponent's turn" in it.  When the first user clicks in the area at 
the end of their turn, the appearances will switch.  This is a simple way to 
indicate the end of your turn without having to type something in the chat 
area repetitively or use the specific phase change buttons (which are 
cumbersome for some uses).
</p>


<p class="sectionheader">
Setting quick chat text choices:
</p>

<p>
The quick chat text combo box contents may be customized by creating a file 
called 'quicktext.dat' in your Holotable installation directory.  Each line 
in the file will appear in the combo box as a quick chat text option.  Once 
Holotable has been restarted, the quick chat text combo box will show your 
customized choices.
</p>


<p class="sectionheader">
Setting default pile positions:
</p>

<p>
The holotable.ini file is written with the positions of the different 
piles each time the options are saved.  If you upgraded to Holotable 
0.4.1, your holotable.ini can be updated with the default settings by 
opening the options dialog and choosing "Apply" or "OK".  You can then 
open holotable.ini and edit the default positions for the piles.
</p>

<p>
For each pile, there are X and Y offsets.  The first value is the X 
offset, which determines how far from either edge of the playing 
surface the particular pile is placed.  The second value is the 
Y offset, which is always from the bottom of the playing surface.
Some players are used to having their piles on their left, which is 
opposite of the default position.  To support anchoring the piles to the 
left side of the playing surface, you add "left" after the Y position
for each pile that you want anchored on the left.  Otherwise, each 
pile will be anchored to the right.
</p>

<p>
To aid in editing your holotable.ini for the particular placement you 
want, the size of the three vertical piles is 66x91 pixels.  The Used 
Pile, which is horizontal, is 91x66 pixels.
</p>

<p class="sectionheader">
Changing chat text colors:
</p>

<p>
In order to make it easier to see which messages in the chat/log area 
are from what source, you can change the color used for each type of 
message.  Informational messages are shown in the color specified in 
the holotable.rc file.  Chat messages from you and your opponent may 
be shown in different colors.  The holotable.ini file keeps this 
information, and Holotable will write the default values (blue for 
you and red for your opponent) to the file each time the options are 
saved if none were in the file when Holotable started.
</p>

<p>
Colors may be specified by name (only the basics are supported) or 
in RGB format.  For RGB format, the values should be separated by 
spaces and be in the range 0 to 65535.
</p>

<p>
Example (these are the lines you'd add to/modify in your holotable.ini):
</p>

<p>
Your text: 3400 78 50000<br />
Opponent's text: orange
</p>

<p class="sectionheader">
Card border feature:
</p>

<p>
If you want your cards to have different borders based on card type, 
edit your "htborders.ini" file.  The format is
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
&lt;card type&gt;: &lt;red value&gt; &lt;green value&gt; &lt;blue value&gt;

                  AND

&lt;card set&gt;: &lt;red value&gt; &lt;green value&gt; &lt;blue value&gt;
</p>

<p>
(without the &lt; and &gt;) The colon is IMPORTANT!
</p>

<p>
Valid card type values are those that are used in your deck files.
For example, if you wanted all interrupts to have a certain color, 
you'd have this line in your htborders.ini file:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
Interrupt: &lt;red&gt; &lt;green&gt; &lt;blue&gt;
</p>

<p>
Valid set values are those used in your deck files.  You can also 
use subsets of these.  So you could make all your virtual cards 
have a certain color with
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
Virtual: &lt;red&gt; &lt;green&gt; &lt;blue&gt;
</p>

<p>
There are two special keywords: OTHERS and NONE.  Using
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
OTHERS: &lt;red&gt; &lt;green&gt; &lt;blue&gt;
</p>

<p>
will result in each card that doesn't match the other card types 
you specified colors for to have this default border color.  You can 
also use NONE like this:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
&lt;card type&gt;: NONE
</p>

<p>
This will result in the specified card type having no border drawn 
for it.  In this case your cards will show up just like the images 
you have (i.e., with the black border from the card image).  You can 
combine OTHERS and NONE , but the effect is the same as just not 
doing so (no borders will be drawn for card types you didn't specify).
</p>

<p>
Valid color values are 0-255.  You can find charts online that tell 
you what color combinations result in what colors, or you can use 
most imaging programs to figure it out.
