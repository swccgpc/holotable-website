<p>The virtual card redux is finally available as updated CDF files. You can get them in a .zip from the <a href="/updates.html">Interim Updates</a> page. The new images will be coming at some point, but don't hold your breath, since there are almost 50 cards to do. I had hoped to release version 0.7.3 of Holotable along with the redux, but I haven't had time to do much and get things tested. So it will have to wait.<br /><br />Matt</p>
