<p>Holotable 0.7.4 is now available. It has user-configurable key bindings, which should please many of you.The file keybindings.ini sets up the bindings, and you can return to the default setup by using the button in the Initialization tab of the Options dialog. Also, the key reference dialog (available under the Help menu) changes based on what you've set your key bindings to be, so as you transition to a custom setup, it will still help you. Note that any of the keys that are menu item accelerators (i.e., are listed beside menu items like "Ctrl-L" for load) cannot be used as the key binding for rotation or flip commands. This is because those commands also use the Control key to detect whether or not to rotate or flip the whole stack. If you try to set something like that up, you'll get a warning and the default setup will be used. So, basically, don't use l, o, s, q, or z for those commands.<br /><br />Also in the update are some fixes for problems with cards snapping to incorrect locations for piles and not being able to fan or look through stacks while in hand.<br /><br />Matt</p>
