<p>From Jeremy (Psychobabble)</p><blockquote>I have been informed that there are a lot of events happening on Saturday 26th July and that it's going to be something of a world SWCCG day. So what better way to celebrate world SWCCG day than to start an online tournament on (around) that date? Here's the details:<br /><br />What: 4 round constructed Swiss online tournament<br />When: Friday 25 July - Sunday 17 August (one round per week - players organise their own matchup times.)<br />Where: Holotable<br />Cost: nothing<br />Prizes: GLORY!!!<br />How to enter: Email me at psychobabbleswccg@gmail.com. Once I have got your email I will reply to confirm your entry and provide you with a copy of the online tournament guide. You must register <b>before Thursday 24th July</b> (US EST) so I am able to do round matchups and notify everyone.</blockquote><p>Matt</p>
