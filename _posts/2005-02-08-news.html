<p>Holotable is no longer offering &quot;corrected&quot; versions of the SWCCG PC Premium Virtual Sets, as the PC has finally released the &quot;officia&quot; ones. </p><p>In other news, LtPage2 is currently working on another update for Holotable. Hopefully it will fix a variety of issues people have been experiencing. Visit the forums for the most up-to-date information. </p>
