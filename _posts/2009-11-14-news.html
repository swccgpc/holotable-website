<p>Holotable 0.8.5 and Holodeck 0.3.4 are now available from the downloads section.<br /><br />Holotable 0.8.5 has the capability to automatically update image files (optional). This is very similar to the CDFand program update capability from 0.8.4. Additionally, the pile search dialog card list comes up in pile order;that is, the top card in the pile is at the top of the card list. The list can be sorted alphabetically byclicking on the column header. A long-standing bug where some people would see cards jump across the table hasbeen fixed.<br /><br />Holodeck 0.3.4 allows the user to create random decks. The sets used as the card pool are selectable. All cardshave the same weight when being selected.<br /><br />If you have 0.8.4 set for trying to download program updates, it's not going to work. It will download the file and then fail to execute it. Apparently I screwed something up in the 0.8.4 code after testing it with the program update function. It appears that the GTK call doesn't work as it should. Anyway, you ought to have a file "ht_temp.exe" in your Holotable install directory after that fails. You can manually run that and get the new versions (it's a normal installer). Alternatively, you can download the update from the Holotable website. I modified (and tested) 0.8.5 so that it should be able to do program updates correctly in the future. I guess we'll have to see what really happens when the time comes.<br /><br />Thanks to MAVanDriel, Accolon, and JediJer for their testing help. Some image updates (available through 0.8.5) are courtesy of Crickett.<br /><br />Matt</p>
