<p>At last...it's here! The final version of Holotable 0.4.0 is released, along with updates for Virtual Set 9 (including large images). Check out the downloads section to get all the goodness.<br /><br />Special thanks go to micokeman3, Rogue4, and rookie for their work on the Virtual Set 9 updates. The only thing I did was make sure their changes all worked together correctly.<br /><br />I am aware of card sync problems that some people have had with the preliminary version of 0.4.0. Some people have had no problems, so I'm not sure what's happening. The final version has some better reporting about what's going on. If you do see a card sync error, please send me the "log.txt" file that is generated. If it's too big to send, let me know that you had a problem so I'll know the frequency of the issue. The log file is overwritten each time you open Holotable, so make sure to send it before you play again.<br /><br />Matt</p>
