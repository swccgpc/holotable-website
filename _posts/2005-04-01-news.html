<p>Version 0.1.2 of Holodeck is released today. It will now "zoom" images when the cursor is placed over the thumbnail on the right. On startup, Holodeck reads the holotable.ini file to get the initial setting on whether you want to use "zoom" or not. There is a checkbox on the main window that will allow you to turn it on or off independently of the Holotable setting (it won't write to your holotable.ini file).<br /><br />Additionally, the three main areas of the window are now resizable with the use of panes (just like you can change the hand area size in Holotable). Finally, there was a problem where Holodeck would crash if you pressed a key while the focus was in either the "select from" or the deck lists. Now that doesn't happen, and you can press 'a' to add a card from the "select from" list or increment the number of a card when it's selected in the deck list. While in the deck list, 'd' will delete one copy of the selected card, and the up and down arrows change the order of cards in the deck.</p>
