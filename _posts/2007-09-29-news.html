<p>Holotable 0.8.2 and Virtual Set 13 updates (plus current errata and Virtual Set 14 preview cards) are now available. Thanks to Psychobabble for providing the card updates. Holotable 0.8.2 includes some better functionality for card groups, automatic version check on startup (optional), support for PNG images, and notification when an objective is flipped.<br /><br />Apologies for having been out of touch for the past many months. Real life has taken priority.<br /><br />Matt</p>
