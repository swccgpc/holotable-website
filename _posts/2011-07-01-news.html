<p>Holotable 0.9.2 (along with Holodeck 0.3.8) is now available from the automatic updater (downloads section files to come soon).<br /><br />Usability changes in Holotable include allowing multiple cards to be selected and pulled in pile search dialogs, 'target'ed cards temporarily highlight, and a popup for the tally command shows the number of cards in the stack. This version fixes a problem with missed messaging from the opponent about manual card movements that occurred immediately after shortcut/command key pile movement.<br /><br />Holodeck received the ability to select (and manipulate) multiple cards in the deck list. This means you can add copies of cards, delete copies of cards, and increment/decrement the number of starting copies for multiple cards at once.<br /><br />Matt</p>
