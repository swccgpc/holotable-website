<p>Holotable 0.7.0 and Holodeck 0.3.0 are now available. Holotable mainly improves the undo/redo functionsso that more things are supported (flipping, rotation, straightening/fanning, etc.). There are some other changes as well, like being able to draw destiny with the 'b' key and cards loading to the Reserve Deck instead of the hand (since you can specify which cards are starting ones). Holotable 0.7.0 should not be used with earlier versions.<br /><br />Holodeck 0.3.0 gives much expanded search capabilities for deckbuilding. The lore and gametext can be searched separately and there are many more options for searching numerical values like power, deploy, ability, etc.<br /><br />Matt</p>
