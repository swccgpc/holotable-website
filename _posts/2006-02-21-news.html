<p>Holotable 0.6.3 is now available. It adds the capability to authenticate with the central server (so that people cannot impersonate others). The server on port 7935 currently runs authenticated. Sometime in the future, the server on 5320 will also be converted to requiring authentication. You must use your username and password from the forums in order to log on. Other changes in this version area fix for a bug in the network code and CDF updates.<br /><br />Matt</p>
