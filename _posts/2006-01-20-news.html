<p>Holotable 0.6.0 is released! This version adds starting cards and out of play piles (like the normal Force Pile, Reserve Deck, etc.). Also, you can now search the Reserve Deck or starting cards pile for a particular card by name. If you're connected to an opponent, your opponent must first approve the search. A few features were added to increase the speed of games. The first is an "Acknowledge" button, which sends a message telling your opponent you acknowledge their last message; this can be used instead of having to click in the chat entry field, type "OK", and send the message. The second feature to make games faster is a key that sends a message saying "I'm using &lt;card title&gt;". Additionally, the stack counts change to red for a short period of time when the count itself changes; this will help people see when their opponent does something regarding a pile and hopefully will discourage cheating. Finally, a few bugs were found and fixed. Remember to report problems and make suggestions for new features in the forums. I won't know what people want if I don't hear anything. Enjoy!<br /><br />Note: Holotable 0.6.0 CANNOT be used with earlier versions.<br /><br />Holodeck 0.2.0 comes with Holotable 0.6.0. It adds the ability to search for cards by words in card the title and/or by words in the lore/gametext. It also allows you to filter cards by set, a feature that was tantalizingly disabled for the first year of Holodeck's existence. You can also choose "All" for both card type (this selection wasn't available before) and card set. Finally, you can export your deck to a plain text listing of the cards (and how many of them there are).<br /><br />Matt</p>
