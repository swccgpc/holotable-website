<p>Yesterday was the first anniversary of the initial release of Holotable (version 0.1.0). It's come a very long way since then. In that first version, there was no way to set the background image, there was no way to chat with your opponent, there were no large images, Holodeck didn't even exist, and lots of stuff didn't work right. I've enjoyed working on this little project this year. We'll see what sorts of improvements and additions can be made in 2006. Merry Christmas!<br /><br />Matt</p>
