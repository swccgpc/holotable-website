<p>Holotable 0.5.0 is released! This includes both Windows and Linux versions. This version, unlike the preliminary release, saves ALL card information to the file when saving a game.This includes the table size, both player's pile positions, and all cards, including the stacking order. This should make it easier for people to resume playing games if a crash occurs. A side effect of this is that all cards are cleared from the table when the correct password is entered to load the game.</p><p>Other examples of improvements in 0.5.0 are:</p><ul><li>Draw and retrieve cards with key commands</li><li>Change the color of your and opponent's chat text in the chat area</li><li>Fixed a problem where stacks could end up underneath other cards when moved</li><li>Shuffling a stack no longer locks the program for a short time</li></ul><p>See readme.txt for a full list of fixes.</p><p>Holodeck 0.1.5 is included in the installers. The changes are minor, but include a fix for a problem where large images could end up never going away, blocking the view of the rest of the program. Also, cards are prepended to the deck list now. This makes more sense from a deck building perspective, since the cards at the end of the list show up at the top of the stack when loaded in Holotable. This means that you can add your starting cards first, and they will be easily accessible when the deck is loaded. Also, you can more easily see the cards you added recently instead of the ones you added first.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Matt</p>
