<p>Version 0.3.1 of Holotable is released today. The main added feature is the ability to "zoom" images instead of seeing the text from the CDF file. When this option is selected and an image for a card is available, the large image will be shown in a popup window. A keyboard reference window was added, and the hand count for each player is shown in a status bar at all times (so you don't have to use a key command to check). Enjoy!</p>
