<p>I've posted new large (and small, for Linux) image installers that are updated through Virtual Set 12. This will make it simpler for people to get the latest images. If you already have the images, please don't download the large image installers -- they're about 240 MB, and that puts a lot of stress on the connection.This is more for people who are starting from scratch. Thanks.<br /><br />Matt</p>
