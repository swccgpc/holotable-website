<p>I've uploaded a preliminary version of Holotable 0.4.1. Make sure you've got 0.4.0 installed, then download and install the Holotable 0.4.1 (prelim) update. I've fixed a few bugs that were still in the network code. They were probably responsible for the occasional card that wasn't flipped correctly for both players, not being able to see the other player's cards, card sync errors, etc. I've also added, as requested, a button in the options dialog that will restore the default table size, window size, and server IP and port number. Also, the table size auto-adjust feature should now work when using the central server for games.<br /><br />As a side note, I will be unavailable for the next week or so because I'll be on vacation. Hopefully 0.4.1 will solve most (if not all) of the major problems, crashes, etc. The central server still has some problems with locking up, which I will work on when I get back. Enjoy!<br /><br />Matt</p>
