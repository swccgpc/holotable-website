<p>As you can see at this point, we've completed switching our hosting over to <a href="https://www.theforce.net">TheForce.net</a>.Many thanks to them for hosting the website and our game server. Please note that the "official" central game server is now located at www.holotable.com, so you should fix your Server IP address field of the Options dialog (Connectivity tab) in Holotable.<br /><br />Holotable 0.8.1 and Holodeck 0.3.2 are now available. They provide some nice updates I think folks will like (many of them have been specifically requested by users). Enjoy!<br /><br />Matt</p>
