<p>Holotable 0.8.6 is now available from the downloads section.<br /><br />It has several bugfixes. A large number of potential jumping card conditions have been removed. A problem with saved games which could crash the program has been fixed. A complicated problem with pile search and verify dialogs which would crash the program has been fixed as well.<br /><br />Matt</p>
