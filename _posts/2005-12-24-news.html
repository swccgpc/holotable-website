<p>Virtual Set 11 has been released by the Player's Committee, and the CDFs for Holotable have been updated. You can now get them with Holotable 0.5.3 update. There are a few improvements to the program as well. Images will be coming in the next few days. If you like, you can copy the small images from the original cards corresponding to the virtual ones to the appropriately named directory in order to get the little version to show up rather than a missing image icon. Thanks to the PC for providing the updated CDFs. Enjoy!<br /><br />Matt</p>
