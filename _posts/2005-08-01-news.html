<p>The Linux version of Holotable 0.5.0 prelim is now available. There is a new download category for Linux; it also includes card image downloads. For some reason, the download system wants to append ".tar" to the end of all the filenames. They are actually just *.tar.bz2 files, so you can cut off the extra when you save them. Linux users, please let it be known how things go with this version (but make sure to read the instructions in the installation section of readme-linux.txt).<br /><br />The download pages, online readme, and Holotable customization instructions should be up sometime later this week. I don't have time to do it right now.<br /><br />Matt</p>
