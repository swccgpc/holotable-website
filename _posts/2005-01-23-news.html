<p>A Deck-making utility (known as Holodeck) is currently in the works.Expect general release shortly. Also, the forums are going to be operation very soon (hopefully). Then you can get help installing/using Holotable. (Until then, just e-mail us with questions). Please remember to come back and register in the forums after they're up and running!</p><p>We're still working on getting the most up-to-date cdf files (all typos corrected, etc), and revised card images (new visual distinction for virtual cards). Expect these updates with next version release. Be sure to check the <a href="/images/screenshot1.jpg">screenshot</a> for a look at Holotable! </p><p style="text-align: center">-Rogue4</p>
