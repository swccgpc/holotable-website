<p>Holotable 0.6.1 is now available. Several new features have been added, perhaps the most important of which is the ability to undo/redo card movements (up to 64 are saved). The movements are "remembered" based on a single click and drag, so movement of a stack only fills one slot in the undo list. In a similar fashion, all pile movements are also remembered together (in the same way they are reported), so if you see "You activated 5 Force", using the undo function will un-activate 5 Force at once. Another useful feature is the ability to load cards to the starting cards pile; the starting cards are designated in Holodeck (see below). The pile search capability was added to the Force Pile, Used Pile, and Lost Pile.<br /><br />Some other improvements/additions are the ability to ensure that all cards are flipped the same way and a listbox of commonly-sent messages to speed gameplay (replaces the "Acknowledge" button). The piles are now anchorable on a per-pile basis, instead of all one way or the other. This makes having piles on separate sides of the table work more sensibly. Pile search dialogs now will show a tooltip containing the text of the selected card; this helps with searching a deck for a card that matches certain criteria (as opposed to searching for a particular card just by title). Finally, a few bugs that caused crashes in 0.6.0 were fixed. The problems with pressing 'q' over a facedown card and pressing OK in the pile search dialog without having selected a card are both fixed.<br />Note: Holotable 0.6.1 CANNOT be used with earlier versions. This is due to the addition of pile search features and undo/redo functionality.<br /><br />Holodeck 0.2.1 comes with the Holotable 0.6.1 update. It supports indicating how many of a particularcard you want loaded to the starting cards pile. Since this changes the file format slightly, the default extension for saved decks is now ".htd"; you will still be able to save and load decks saved as ".ctd". Another added feature is that destiny number is an option when searching for cards. A new "Deck" menu was added. From it, you can choose to calculate your deck's average destiny (excluding the cards that are set to be starting cards). You can also simulate your opening draw. Holodeck will internally randomize the non-starting cards and "draw" the top eight, displaying the results in a dialog box.<br /><br />Matt</p>
