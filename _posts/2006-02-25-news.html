<p>Holotable 0.6.4 is now available. It fixes a few bugs that have been causing intermittment crashes for people. Particularly, the fixes are for crashes when using the 'q' key and when drawing cards into hand with 'd' or 'w'. There's also the capability to hide the card searched for and pulled from a pile.<br /><br />I plan to make the main server (on port 5320) into an authenticated server when Holotable 0.7.0 comes out. I have no timeline for this right now, but there will be a number of changes that break backwards compatibility, so it's as good a time as any. At that point, no one will be able to impersonate anyone else anymore.<br /><br />Matt</p>
