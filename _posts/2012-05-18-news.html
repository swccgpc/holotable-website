<p>Finally, a new release!  Holotable 0.9.4 is now available, and it has the single most-requested feature to date --    the ability to observe in-progress games on the central server!  Players have the option to accept or reject    observation requests, and they may kick out any observer at any time. Observers may enter and leave the observed    game whenever they like; in the game they can chat with everyone but may not manipulate cards or see either    player's hand. Users in a player's "Ignore list" on the server will have observation requests automatically    rejected, with no notification/interruption to the player.<br />   <br />   Other changes include a fix to a long-standing problem with loading and clearing decks. Both players will now see    chat messages that are loaded with saved games, instead of just the player who loaded the saved game file. A player    who ends a game with the "End game" menu item now has the chance to save the game if any cards were loaded at the    time. Previously the save game dialog appeared, but the cards were cleared before a save could be done.<br />   <br />   Matt</p>
