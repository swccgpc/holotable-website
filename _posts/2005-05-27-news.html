<p>If you've been having trouble with card sync errors in 0.4.0, download Holotable.exe a new Holotable executable and overwrite your old one with it. This may cut down on the card sync errors. From the investigating I've done, it looks like GTK may be giving incorrect data that the code uses to send card updates. If that's the case, I will have to rework the code that figures out where cards are. Please let me know if this fixes things for you (e-mail or on the forums). If you still have problems, I need to know that, too, obviously. Just make sure that whoever you're playing against has this version (it is not in any of the installers).<br /><br />Matt</p>
