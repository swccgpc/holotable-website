<p>Holotable 0.9.1 (along with Holodeck 0.3.7) is now available from the downloads section.<br /><br />Usability changes in Holotable include the ability to cycle through fan spacings for a stack by using the Control key in conjunction with the fan key and place cards under the starting cards pile using the , (comma) key.Also fixed was a card context menu problem that resulted in cards "jumping" when clicking on the table to cancel the menu.<br /><br />Holodeck received the ability to increment/decrement the number of copies of a card marked as starting; this is done using the 's' and 'r' keys, respectively. A bug that zeroed the starting card count when a previously-saved deck was loaded has been fixed. The average destiny dialog was changed to provide information about the distribution of each destiny (0-7 and other); this uses the cards in the deck not marked as starting, and cards with multiple destiny numbers have the higher destiny used for the counts.<br /><br />Matt</p>
