<p>Holotable 0.5.1 is available. It should fix the problem that some people have seen where recirculation does not work correctly for the opponent. It also adds intelligent reporting of cards being moved from pile to pile with the key commands. For example, five successive presses of the 'a' key are reported in the chat/log area as activation of 5 Force (instead of five separate "You activated 1 Force" messages). Updated CDFs are also included in the installer.<br /><br />Be sure not to use 0.5.1 with earlier versions. There are a few things that are incompatible, so you will see weird things happen if you do.<br /><br />Matt</p>
