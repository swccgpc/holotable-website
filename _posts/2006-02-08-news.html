<p>Psychobabble has put together a deck pack that new players (or returning ones) can use to get a quick start playing SWCCG. It contains 4 decks for each side of the Force and has a short description of how to play each deck. You can get the deck pack from the Downloads &amp; Links page. Look for the heading "Deck Pack".<br /><br />Matt</p>
