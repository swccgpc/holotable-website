<p>The corrected versions of <a href="https://res.starwarsccg.org/cards/Images-HT/starwars/Coruscant-Light/large/coruscantjedicouncilchamber.gif">Coruscant: Jedi Council Chamber</a> and <a href="https://res.starwarsccg.org/cards/Images-HT/starwars/Coruscant-Dark/large/naboobattleplains.gif">Naboo: Battle Plains (dark)</a> are available. These images are smaller than most large images, but larger than the thumbnails. It appears that they were posted in a smaller size originally by Decipher, so this is the best there is (unless I'm an idiot and copied the wrong ones, which is possible). Just save the images to your <br /><br />&lt;Holotable installation directory&gt;\cards\starwars\&lt;appropriate set name&gt;\large\<br /><br />directory and overwrite the ones that were there.<br /><br />A Virtual Set 10 spoiler (one card) is posted in the Holotable Discussion forum. Check it out if you'd like.<br /><br />Matt</p>
