<p>If you're interested, you can download a preliminary version of Holotable 0.4.0 from the download area. I'd like for some people to try it out and give some feedback, particularly people that have been experiencing crashes. Among the changes I made was a fairly extensive rewrite of the network code, which should make Holotable considerably more stable when connected to another player. I also put in some logging so that, if it does crash on you, you can email me the "log.txt" file so I can try to track down what exactly happened. If you want to know what other changes there are, download it and see. :) A concise list is in the readme.txt file that will be updated when you install.<br /><br />There are several things you should note:<br /></p><ul><li>0.4.0 is NOT compatible with earlier versions. So don't try to play a game with someone who hasn't updated.</li><li>Because of the above, you might want to make a backup of your old Holotable.exe so you can switch back if you want to play with an earlier version.</li><li>It has always been important, but I want to reemphasize that you need to have the playing surface size set to the same values. To prevent problems, if you find that you have to change sizes to match your opponent, you should make the change, then restart Holotable.</li><li>I also want to reemphasize the importance of making sure the table is clear of all cards before connecting to your opponent. After connection, one person should load his deck, then the other person should load his. If you try to load at the same time, it's pretty much guaranteed that you'll get errors.</li><li>This is a preliminary version. I will be making a few more changes and tweaks to things before it becomes "official". But I do want your comments if you try it out.</li></ul><p>On another note, the server has been having connectivity problems the past few days. Hopefully the ISP will get a clue and get it straightened out. If you can't reach the site or central game server, just try again later sometime.</p>
