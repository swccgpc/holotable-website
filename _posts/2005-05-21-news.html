<p>Unfortunately, we do not yet have everything together for Virtual Set 9 updates. I am moving today and will not have Internet access from home until sometime next week. I will, however, have access from work, so it's possible that if everything comes together, I could release Holotable 0.4.0 along with updates for Virtual Set 9 at the beginning of the week. We'll just have to see, though.</p>
