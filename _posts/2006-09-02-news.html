<p>We're finally back up after 6 weeks of downtime. Really sorry about that, guys. The server got fried in a lightning storm at the end of July, and a number of things have combined to make the comeback very slow indeed. But things are working again.<br /><br />You'll find that Holotable 0.7.3 is now available. It includes the ability to group cards so you don't have to move associated ones like stacks anymore. However, it's not terribly advanced, so make sure you destroy groups before you try to move any of the cards in them to piles, etc. Also, there is more advanced reporting available; this tells you when your opponent moves cards to and from piles, flips cards on piles, etc. It won't work entirely correctly if your opponent is not using 0.7.3, however, so don't rely on what it says unless that's the case. See the readme file for details on how to use the new features.<br /><br />I'll be updating the website with more downloads and such, possibly tonight and tomorrow. Look for full redux images (thanks to Psychobabble) and updates to documentation, etc.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the game server has returned on port 5320. Hit "Restore defaults" in the Connectivity tab of Holotable's options to get the setup easily.<br /><br />Matt</p>
