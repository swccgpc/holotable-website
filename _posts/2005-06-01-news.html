<p>Oops. I accidentally deleted the updated executable I had posted in the link below. I don't have the same file with me at the moment, so instead I've uploaded a better version that I've been making changes to. It will be the preliminary 0.4.1 after a few more fixes.<br /><br /> On that note, I believe I've fixed the server bugs that were causing it to crash so often. It has been up since yesterday evening with 14 games played and no crash. Before the fix it probably would have crashed ~6 times over that many games. Hopefully I haven't spoken too soon and it will continue to work correctly. As always, let me know if you can't get to it or something goes wrong while you're playing a game on the server.<br /><br />As another point of good news, I think I've found the bug that was causing intermittent problems with cards being flipped for one person and not the other. The fix will be in preliminary 0.4.1, which I plan to release later this week.<br /><br />Finally, for those of you who are trying to use Windows 98, I was successful in making Holotable run on my old Windows 98 machine over the weekend. So it can be done. If you have problems, ask for help and I'll try to help you get it working.<br /><br />Matt</p>
