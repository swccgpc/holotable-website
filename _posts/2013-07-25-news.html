<p>Holotable 0.9.6 is available through the update system. It tries to fix a lockup problem when an observation request    comes in. It also has a new feature to allow swapping one or more cards from hand with one from the Lost Pile. A    fix was put in to correct card orientations for observers on initial load.<br />   <br />   Matt</p>
