<p>Holotable 0.4.1 is now available for download. If you already have Holotable version 0.4.0 or above, you can just download the Holotable 0.4.1 update and install that. If you don't have Holotable at all, just download Holotable 0.4.1 and you'll have what you need. Just remember that you have to download the large images separately if you want to use them.<br /><br />Holotable 0.4.1 fixes several leftover network problems from 0.4.0 and fixes some bugs related to moving large stacks of cards, rotation when a card is in a special pile, etc. The added features are the ability to use keyboard shortcuts to activate Force ('a'), use Force ('u'), and lose from the top of the Reserve Deck ('l', cards are automatically flipped faceup if they were not already). Default pile positions can also be specified through the holotable.ini file, for those of you who don't want to be moving them to your preferred position all the time. Check the readme (which is also online) for details. A side effect of this default positioning is that pile positions are automatically sent to your opponent when you connect. Finally, there are a few minor things like less memory usage (large images are loaded as needed, then unloaded) and more messages in the chat log.<br /><br />The Holotable 0.4.1 installers also include Holodeck 0.1.4, which adds the ability to 'jump' to cards in the selection list by pressing the first letter of the card name. It will jump to the first card that starts with that letter, which will make it a little easier to navigate. Also, the arrow keys can be used to change the selected card in both the selection and deck lists. Previously, the arrow keys changed the card order in the deck list; that can still be done with the up and down buttons.<br /><br />I want to say thanks to Frank Walsh for originally proposing the idea about Force Pile, Reserve Deck, and Used Pile to me. I think everyone would agree that it's one of the improvements in Holotable lately.<br /><br />On another note, versions of Holotable and Holodeck for Linux are in the works. If you run Linux and are interested in having a version for your particular flavor, please e-mail me and let me know.<br /><br />Matt</p>
