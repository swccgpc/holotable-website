<p>Holotable 0.7.2 is now available. It features several enhancements to "single player mode" which will help people playtest without having to have an opponent. The first of these is the ability to save the game when not connected to an opponent (this sort of save will not load when connected to an opponent, and viceversa). The other enhancement to single player mode is the ability to "swap sides" with a keypress ('Q') or button press; swapping sides reverses your view of the table and swaps hands. This will make it much easier to play against yourself; note that this feature only works when not connected, so you won't be able to use it to see your opponent's hand when you're in a real game. :)<br /><br />Some other new features: press 'm' to "target" a card (similar to "using" a card), the ability to choose the fan amount (small, medium, or large), and a quick command bar to supplement the pile and search commands previously available only with key presses. Also, a bug relating to undoing several types of actions, which was introducedin 0.7.1, has been fixed. Also, now clicking on empty areas in your hand or the table removes focus from the chat text field so that you can use key commands again (instead of the key presses going to the chat text field).<br />Additionally, the virtual card errata recently released by the PC are included in the updated CDF files. Updated images for those cards are to come sometime soon. Hopefully this new stuff will sort of make up for the website and game server being down all last week. Enjoy!<br /><br />Matt</p>
