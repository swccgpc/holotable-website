<p>Virtual Set 10 is now supported! Download and install the V10 Update, which is available on the right menu (or in the Card Images download category). The installer includes the large and small images and the updated CDF files. The large images make the installer somewhat big, so if you're on dialup and don't want to download all 1.6 MB, let me know. I'll create an installer that just has the new CDFs and the small V10 images.<br /><br />The corrected versions of <a href="https://res.starwarsccg.org/cards/Images-HT/starwars/Virtual0-Light/large/hansheavyblasterpistol.gif">Han's Heavy Blaster Pistol (V)</a> and <a href="https://res.starwarsccg.org/cards/Images-HT/starwars/Virtual0-Light/large/leia.gif">Leia (V)</a> are available. These are fixes to the text that the PC made after the cards were created (or else old files were used in the first place). They are from Virtual Set 1 and 3, respectively.<br /><br />Holotable 0.4.2 is just around the corner; the main added feature is the ability to load and save decks. This will make online tournaments a more realistic possibility. I need some people to test it out to make sure things work correctly before it gets released. Email me if you'll have time in the next couple of weeks and want to help out. I also plan to release a Linux version when 0.4.2 comes out. If you're a Linux user and can help, please let me know.<br /><br />Matt</p>
