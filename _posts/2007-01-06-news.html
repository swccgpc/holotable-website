<p>Holotable 0.8.0 is now available. It adds several new features, such as controls for changing phases (coordinated between the players) and pausing the game, country selection for display in the central server dialog, the ability to put the chat/log area in a separate window, additional commands in the card context menu, and "keepalive" messages that prevent some routers from automatically shutting down connections when there hasn't been other network traffic for a while. Additionally, your password is now hashed before sending it to the central server when you log on; this keeps your password more secure. Finally, there were two bugs: custom key bindings for searching piles would not work, and fanning a stack could result in cards moving outside the table area. These are fixed.<br /><br />Also included in the new version are card text updates for the virtual card re-edit. Images will be fixed at some point -- if the PC's card database gets its images updated soon, I will use those. Otherwise, I don't know when I might have time to do them. Please volunteer if you'd like to help.<br /><br />Please note that the game server on port 5320 (the main one) is now set up to work only with Holotable 0.8.0.If you try to log on with an earlier version, you will fail to authenticate (because the server is no longer accepting plain-text passwords). The server gives a message indicating that version 0.8.0 is required. The game server on port 7935 will be available for games between players using non-0.8.0 versions for a few weeks.<br /><br />Matt</p>
