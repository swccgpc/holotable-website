<p>At some point in the next couple of days, this site and the game server will move to hosting by <a href="https://www.theforce.net">TheForce.net</a>.This should improve our uptime and prevent the sort of long outages we've experienced twice in the last year.We also should have access to more resources as a result of theforce.net's support of SWCCG. A side effect of this change will be that the IP address for the server is no longer important in and of itself: all pages on this site will be relative to "www.holotable.com" instead of "&lt;IP address&gt;/holotable" (so update any bookmarks you have!). Also, you should be able to use "www.holotable.com" in the Server IP address field of the Options dialog (Connectivity tab) in Holotable.<br /><br />It should be obvious when the new hosting is in effect. Be on the alert for switching game server IPs once you see that things have switched over.<br /><br />As something of an "extra bonus", Holotable 0.8.1 and Holodeck 0.3.2 will be available for download from the site after the switch. Holotable 0.8.1 has a number of usability improvements, the most obvious of which are a convenience function for initiating Force drains at locations and being able to toggle between large image popups and card text tooltips on the fly without affecting your default setting. Holodeck 0.3.2 contains some long-awaited upgrades: multiple-character "jump to card" support (replacing the ability to jump to the first card in the from list that started with a given character), a view of your deck that has the ability to sort by column, a card summary display for your deck (gives number of cards of given types), and support for quick reordering of your deck load order by selecting a card and using CTRL plus the up/down arrow keys.<br /><br />Matt</p>
