<p>There was an error in the initial release of the Dark Side CDF - Vader's Anger (V) was still listed as a Used or Lost Interrupt in its text. It's now fixed. If you're one of the 8 or so people who got the incorrect version, please don't download again. Just change it yourself in the CDF if you want it to be right.<br /><br />Matt</p>
