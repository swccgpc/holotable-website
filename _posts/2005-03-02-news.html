<p>I've made good progress on implementing a server lobby that will allow people connected to it to chat and choose their opponent (rather than the current setup of blindly connecting to whoever was the last person who connected and didn't get paired with another user). You will be given the option of accepting or rejecting a game request. Accepting a request will connect you to your opponent (through the server) and close the server chat/opponent selection dialog. You can then load decks and start playing. Look for this feature to be released sometime in the next two weeks! There will probably be a couple of other minor changes, and possibly a CDF and/or card image update.</p>
