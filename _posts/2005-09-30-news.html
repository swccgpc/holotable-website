<p>The website and game servers are now back up after the ISP changed the IP address of the server machine (it's supposed to be static). Grrr. Anyway, things should be working again.You'll need to change the server IP address in your Holotable options if you use the central server to play. The new IP is 68.110.108.233. Hopefully it won't change again.<br /><br />Matt</p>
