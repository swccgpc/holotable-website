<p>The Virtual Set 11 card images are now available, as is Holotable 0.5.4. The new version adds the option of enabling context menus for cards/stacks, which can be used to do things like flip, shuffle, fan, etc. This time there is a full installer, so that anyone who's just starting to use Holotable can download that and have everything as up to date as possible. The large image set that includes everything through Virtual Set 11 is uploading now and will be available later tonight. This is for people that are starting from scratch; if you already have the other large images, just download the V11 Update in the Card Images section.<br /><br />Matt</p>
