<p>From the PC Online Tournament Commitee:</p><blockquote>Online Cube Tournament - May 2008<br /><br />Registration is now open for the first ever online cube tournament, run by the Online Tournament Committee. Tom Hollingworth (WiseMarsellus) will be the Tournament Director. To register, send an email expressing interest and your choice of pod (see below) to hollingt@bc.edu. Registration will extend until 6 PM Friday, May 23rd. There will be no cost for registration.<br /><br />The Cube is the PC's way of bringing sealed deck to SWCCG. The cards in the cube have been selected to create a balanced and enjoyable draft experience for all players.<br /><br />The draft will happen in real time over AIM. Each player drafts in groups of up to 5 players of the same side. Random 9 card 'packs' will be generated and sent to each participant in the tournament who will then draft a card and send the remaining cards on to the next player. Once the first pack is exhausted, it will be done again until 5 packs have been drafted and each player has 45 cards. Players will then build a 40 card deck from these cards and from the 13 fixed locations available for their side. In order to ensure there is no cheating, players will then send their completed draft sheets in an email to the tournament director.<br /><br />Drafting will take place in live pods via AIM. The tournament will have two draft pods, one beginning at Saturday, May 24th 2200 GMT and the other beginning at Sunday, May 25th 1200 GMT. Please allow for a maximum of 2 hours for drafting. If you cannot make either of the pods email Tom with a time that you can make and he will try to match you into a pod.<br /><br />Players will then play a 4 round swiss tournament with their decks, with each round extending from Monday until 10 PM Sunday. All games must be played on holotable. Results should be communicated to the TD by emailing hollingt@bc.edu. Pairings will be posted on the PC forums every week by 10 AM Monday.</blockquote><p>Matt</p>
