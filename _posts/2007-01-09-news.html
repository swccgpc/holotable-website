<p>With many thanks to Psychobabble, you can now download the virtual card re-edit images. The installer also includes a copy of the CDFs (with a fix for switched Gold Leader in Gold 1 text that was in the Holotable 0.8.0 installers) for the re-edit. Look for Virtual Set 12 updates to come sometime in the days ahead.<br /><br />Matt</p>
