<p>Holotable 0.2.2 is released. It fixes a problem where cards could end up flipped for one player but not the other. It also fixes some of the most annoying flicker related to selecting cards (it isn't all gone...yet...). Enjoy! Sometime soon we'll have updated virtual card images that reflect how the cards actually look.</p><p>Another tidbit: I updated the Holotable server program. It should be more stable than the previous one. It's been running since Friday (three days ago) and hasn't crashed yet. I'm working on getting Holotable and the server to support displaying users who are connected and allowing the choice of an opponent (along with "chat" for those connected to the server).</p>
