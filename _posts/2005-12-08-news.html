<p>Holotable 0.5.2 is available. It should fix the problem that some people have seen where piles "jump" around the table. Thanks to Fluke Skywalker for pinpointing a way to make the problem occur repeatedly; with his information, I was able to figure out what was going on.<br /><br />The installer includes updated CDF files that include the recent errata for five virtual cards. Linux users, I will post the CDFs on the Interim Updates page soon. Coming up soon will be updated images for those cards, as well as Virtual Set 11 when the PC releases it. I may be able to get everything in advance so the updates will be ready for download as soon as the PC makes it official. We'll see...<br /><br />Matt</p>
