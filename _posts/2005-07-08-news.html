<p>It was pointed out that the large image for Maul's Double-Bladed Lightsaber was squished. A corrected version is <a href="https://res.starwarsccg.org/cards/Images-HT/starwars/ReflectionsIII-Dark/large/maulsdoublebladedlightsaber.gif">available</a>. Just save the image to your <br /><br />&lt;Holotable installation directory&gt;\cards\starwars\ReflectionsIII-Dark\large\<br /><br />directory and overwrite the one that was there.<br /><br />As an update, I'm currently working on load/save game functionality. Things are going pretty well with it, and once it's done, Holotable should more or less be tournament-capable. A Linux version of Holotable is coming soon...I've just run into a few problems with it that need fixing.<br /><br />Matt</p>
