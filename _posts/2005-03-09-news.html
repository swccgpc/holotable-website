<p>Holotable 0.3.0 is out! It supports a server lobby, which allows users to chat with and find other players for a game. Currently it is only available as an update to 0.2.2, so if you don't have Holotable at all, you'll need to download and install 0.2.2, then download and install the update. In the next week or so there will be a full installer, which will also include virtual card image updates and CDF file corrections. Version 0.3.0 is not yet available for those of you using GTK 2.4. That should come soon as well.<br /><br />When you have 0.3.0 installed, make sure to change your username (in Table->Options). Also, the port number for the server that supports the lobby is 5320; it's already changed in the updated options file you'll get from the installer. The old server will still be available for a while on 7935. It is compatible with 0.3.0, in the case that you want to play someone on it. <strong>The server on 5320 is not compatible with versions older than 0.3.0!</strong></p>
