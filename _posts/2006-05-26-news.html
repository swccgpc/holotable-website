<p>It's been a while, but Holotable 0.7.1 and Holodeck 0.3.1 are now available. Holotable only has a fewchanges: you have the option of loading cards to your hand (like pre-0.7.0) or your Reserve Deck, and you can use the 'B' (capital b) key to move a card from the top of Reserve Deck to your Used Pile(facedown). The 'B' key is to help make things faster when drawing destinies.<br /><br />Holodeck 0.3.1 has a few features/additions. You can select basic or advanced search (basic search makes thewindow smaller for those of you with limited screen space), see card type in the "cards to choose from" list, use keyboard shortcuts for the Search and Clear buttons, and cycle through cards that start with a letter by continually pressing the corresponding key.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Matt</p>
