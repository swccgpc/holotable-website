<p>Again with many thanks to Psychobabble, you can now download the Virtual Set 12 images and CDFs. There's no way I would have gotten the updates done by myself anytime soon. So let him know how grateful you are for the HOURS he spent on this and the re-edit. He actually got them to me two days ago (very quick!), but my Internet was down all yesterday, so I couldn't make things available until today.<br /><br />I will be creating a new large image installer that includes updates through V12. This will keep people starting from scratch from having to download 4 image installers to have everything up to date.<br /><br />Matt</p>
